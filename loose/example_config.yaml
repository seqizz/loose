# This is an auto-generated example configuration for loose ðŸ« 

# Here we define what happens when we have X amount of screens connected
on_screen_count:
  # If we have 1 screen connected, we will use this section
  1:
    # This is an ordered list, so we will first try this configuration
    # It says that we want to use the screen named eDP-1
    - eDP-1:
        # We want to set its resolution to 1920x1080
        resolution: 1920x1080
        # and its refresh rate to 60Hz
        frequency: 60

    # As you can see, we can have multiple configurations for the same screen.
    # If we rotate the configuration (or previous one is unapplicable
    # due to declared screen's capabilities), we will try the next one.

    # In next preference we don't give any configuration options. This means all
    # options you'll see are optional. If you don't specify them, they will
    # be set to the "preferred" settings from xrandr. You can check the preferred
    # settings by running `xrandr` and looking for `+` in the output.
    - eDP-1:

    # Please note the screen name starts with an underscore on this one. This means
    # this is an "alias". When loose starts, it will try to find suitable screens
    # for all aliases (and it will try to be consistent between starts).
    # By this way we can define (purposefully) vague configurations,
    # and loose will try to find the best match for it on screens which
    # will have different names/capabilities.

        resolution: 1920x1200
        frequency: 60

  # Now let's say we have 2 screens connected
  2:
    # First one is simple, we want to use single screen if
    # any of the screens connected can supply the resolution/rate we want.
    # Please note: In this case other monitor will be "disabled".
    - _1:
        resolution: 3440x1440

    # If we can't find one which matches above rule, we will try to utilize
    # both screens below. One of them will be the primary screen,
    # and the other one will be placed to the right of it.
    # Valid options for placement are: left-of, right-of, above and below
    #
    # Rotation is also supported.
    # Valid values are: normal (default), left, right and inverted.
    #
    # Please keep in mind if any of the screens can't supply the resolution we want,
    # this section will be skipped.

    # As you can see we also support hooks, which will run before/after applying the config.
    # They should be defined in the same level with monitor/alias names.
    # Please note that a failing hook will not stop the operation, it will be only logged.

    # You can guess what we're trying to do above: Explicitly disabling the laptop's monitor
    # (eDP-1) and putting 2 extra screens next to each other. We prefer the one on the left
    # to be the primary.
    # Your monitors can supply the needed resolutions but you might not like the placement
    # and want to swap it. (E.g. loose assigned _1 alias to the "wrong" monitor).
    # With this configuration, you can simply rotate to the next one.

# This is the failback configuration. If we can't find any suitable configuration
# or something goes wrong, we will rely on this one. So it's a good idea to keep
# this one as simple as possible. If you're a laptop user, you can use this
# section to define your laptop screen's exact name.
# Also please note that global_failback only supports single device configuration, not a list!
